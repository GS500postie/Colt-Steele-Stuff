      <h2>Stuff I understand intuitively</h2>
      <ul>
<li>Colours and background-colour properties</li>
<li>RGB and named colour properties</li>
<li>Basic text stuff</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>So where do I further learn these things? I think if I need to look up stuff I still need refreshers but I'm sticking with the knowledge I have. Additional notes have been added in the lesson pages, but I really need to organise this information.</p>
    <p>I really need to start looking at block level elements for what they are. That demonstration showing text right-aligned but in a 50% block really made me think. I really need to think in boxes, and when I get into it for the year I have to be stringent about the even theory/practical divide</p>
    <p>Also adding as a side note: I need to severely limit bad habits. I need to have a good decision/bad decision tree for every day until I get to control bad habits (too much social media, smoking, drinking). I'm at a good starting point but I won't get any meaningful results this year if I don't actively tackle these problems.</p>
    <p>(Additional note: Re-reading this 5/6/25. Still smoking too much but I've actually quit drinking during the week! Also have deleted all social media from my phone so I'm not actually doing too bad!)</p>
