String template literals use **backticks**

**Syntax;**

`hello number ${3 + 4}` (= hello number 7)

(If you used quotes it would have just printed out a string)

(not showing the backticks here but they do surround the command)

Math.floor(Math.random() \* 10) + 1; Will return a number between 1 and 10

(I wonder if I can turn the above into it's own function and give a name like 'randomGenerator or something)
