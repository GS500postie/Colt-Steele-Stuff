      <h1>Bootstrap (Week 11)</h1>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary">Secondary</button>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-success">Success</button>

        Danger Button

        Go to the Bootsrap docs and follow the installation instructions. Don't
        download the whole file: link to the url. I am also disabling Tailwind
        auto-formatting. To bring back Tailwind, go to the command pallette and
        click on Tailwind fold: toggle automatic class folding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also add the two bootstrap links. Don't forget the javascript one and
        add it at the end of the page (before the closing body tag)
      </p>
      <p>
        We are first going to look at the CONTAINER component, which is under
        LAYOUT in the docs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I added the button above by literally copying and pasting the code on
        the docs! (The classes listed in the bootstrap docs are not set-in-stone
        colours, but rather a way to add classes in a way to have a standard
        class labelling system. You can change the actual colours, it's just
        easier to read the code when you have consistent classes)
      </p>
      <p>
        In the example of the buttons, they don't always have to be buttons. You
        can style links, inputs etc. The styling just uses the btn class. You'll
        find more in the docs. (I added more buttons, but changed the text in
        the last two) (changed the last two to small and large)
      </p>
      <p>I really should go through the Tailwind docs as well</p>
