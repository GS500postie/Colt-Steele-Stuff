      We are talkiing about <strong>absolute</strong> and
      <strong>relative</strong> font uses. Relative is more important. Pixels
      are absolute. Ems and rems, % and vh/vw are better because they respond to
      viewport resizing

      Cuttlefish, or cuttles, are marine molluscs of the suborder Sepiina. They
      belong to the class Cephalopoda which also includes squid, octopuses, and
      nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which
      is used for control of buoyancy. Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils,
      eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers, with
      which they secure their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25
      cm (6 to 10 in), with the largest species, the giant cuttlefish (Sepia
      apama), reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb)
      in mass.[1]

      Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopuses, worms, and
      other cuttlefish. Their predators include dolphins, larger fish (including
      sharks), seals, seabirds, and other cuttlefish. The typical life
      expectancy of a cuttlefish is about 1â€“2 years. Studies are said to
      indicate cuttlefish to be among the most intelligent invertebrates.[2]
      Cuttlefish also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all
      invertebrates.[2] The Greco-Roman world valued the cuttlefish as a source
      of the unique brown pigment the creature releases from its siphon when it
      is alarmed. The word for the cuttlefish in both Greek and Latin, sepia,
      now refers to the reddish-brown color sepia in English.

      "Cuttle" in "cuttlefish", sometimes called "cuttles",[3] is derived from
      the Old English name for the species, cudele. The word may be cognate with
      the Old Norse koddi (cushion) and the Middle Low German Kudel (rag)
