        <h2>NOTES</h2>
      </div>
      <h3>Stuff I know</h3>
      <p>
        Firstly the css is terrible in this but I'll get better as I go along.
      </p>
      <p>Block and inline elements</p>
      <p>content, margin, padding, border and border-box</p>
      <h3>Explanations</h3>
      <p>
        If the display is <strong>block</strong> the box will break onto a new
        line. Padding, margin and border will cause other elements to be pushed
        away from the box. <strong>width</strong> and
        <strong>height</strong> will be respected. If <strong>width</strong> is
        not specified, the box will extend in the inline direction to fill the
        space available in the container. In most cases the box will extend 100%
        across the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note the paragraph about <strong>margin collapsing.</strong> This will
        be helpful when the margins don't behave as expected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice you can get more granular with border styling. Handy to know just
        in case.
      </p>
      <p>Do the 'test your skills' page occasionally if you need a refresh.</p>
      <p>
        Before we leave this page find a good Youtube video on the box model,
        the most info that can be fitted in under 10 miutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice that there is another styling property called
        <strong>outline</strong> which is a line <strong>outside</strong> the
        element's border. Outlines DON'T TAKE UP SPACE, so they don't affect the
        layout of the document in any way. Outlines are good for exposing the
        elements by injecting a red outline in the code to spot all the boxes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note for future self: seriously rewatch that sartori design video
        (master layout design) because there is so much gold about layout design
        in there. Make a project to really help drill this into memory. Also,
        maybe try replicating a website you find, and redo it using the
        principles in the video. Look at the website, really get to understand
        the construction of the layout, then watch the video and apply the
        principles within to improve the design.
