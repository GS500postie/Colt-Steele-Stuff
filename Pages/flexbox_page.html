        Also, this is fucking terrible but I worked it up myself in a half an
        hour. Keep doing more and I'll get there. Colour pallette terrible, but
        it does resize.

        It's important to focus on the CONCEPTS of flexbox, not the individual
        properties. If you can understand flexbox conceptually, it will be
        easier to use.

        <strong>Justify-Content</strong> aligns items along the MAIN axis, be it
        horizontal (row) or vertical (column).

      <p class="content">
        Play around with <strong>flex-grow</strong>. Also combine this with
        min/max width.

      <p class="content">
        Investigate flex shorthand (do a bunch of examples on this page)
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        (go into inspector and try the website on different sizes to test
        responsive design. look up MDN media queries)
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        You can also orient media queries to phone orientation. And you can
        check this with the rotate feature in the dev tools
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        To separate a nav bar into an icon (or home button) on the left, and a
        signup button on the right, with three more nav items in the middle,
        group the three middle links in a UL, so that when you apply flexbox it
        is considered ONE element. Then you can style that within its OWN
        flexbox. The interesting thing I'm finding here is that you really need
        to think about layout not from a coding perspective; you have to do a
        bit of lateral thinking.

        Go back and redo the styling of previous pages. Or should I keep them
        and produce adjacent pages showing the improvements?

        Just a tip: If you want to deliniate a line under an element, just add a
        border bottom
