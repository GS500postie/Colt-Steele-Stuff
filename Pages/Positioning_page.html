        I designed this page using reverse engineering. I had been away helping
        mum and was totally out of the loop but for some reason came back and
        not only picked up where I left off but also somehow UNDERSTOOD how to
        pick apart a web page using the devtools. This is wild! And you can't
        take anything away from it; it's ingrained. That is so awesome. I am
        thoroughly enjoying the fact that I somehow managed to keep learning
        away from the computer because I didn't think about any of this while I
        was away; it just came out when I started designing the page. Firstly I
        went to the Code Tidbits page just to see if she had anything on
        positioning but I thought I would try and copy aspects of her page for
        reference reasons and ended up doing a whole lot more. Friggin' AWESOME!

        We have to learn about anchor positioning because it's a new property
