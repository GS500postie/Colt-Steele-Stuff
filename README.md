Just making a repo of stuff I've been working on. I have been doing practical application to really drive the concepts home. 
We had a blackout and my computer was abruptly shut down so I created this repo to insure against loss. 
There is some useful learning in here and I will have comprehensive links pages so I can have easy access to the resources. 
Ultimately I want to include a resource at the end of this, then shift that to a 'resources' repo.
